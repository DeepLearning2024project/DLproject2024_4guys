%	对于寿命较长的电子原件，如10年、20年等，我们不可能实实在在地检测其数据，直到其损坏。经济的做法是对其寿命进行预测。在本文中，我们利用收集的一类电子管的、其电流的时间序列数据，预测其寿命情况。我们使用LSTM、TCN、GRU、RNN、MLP作为Batchmark，探究Autoformer以及Timesnet在此类问题上的性能，并尝试做出改进
For electronic components with a long life, such as 10 years, 20 years, etc., it is impossible for us to actually detect its data until it is damaged. The economic way to do this is to make predictions about its lifespan. In this paper, we use the time series data collected from a kind of electron tube and its current to predict its lifetime. We use LSTM, TCN, GRU, RNN, MLP as batchmark to explore the performance of Autoformer as well as Timesnet on such problems and try to make improvements
