\section{Proposed Innovations}
\label{sec:innovation}
%本实验的创新点分为数据集创新和算法创新。其中数据集创新方面由于本实验所用的数据集是组内成员采集的原创数据集因此数据集创新已经实现，而算法创新方面，拟通过修改调试实现Autoformer: %Decomposition Transformers with Auto-Correlation for Long-Term Series Forecasting及TIMESNET: TEMPORAL 2D-VARIATION MODELING FOR GENERAL TIME SERIES ANALYSIS论文中
%的方法，查看这两种方法在原创数据集上的效果，并与LSTM，RNN，TCN等传统方法对比，探索一种效果更好的方法。
The innovations in this experiment can be divided into two aspects: dataset innovation and algorithm innovation.

For dataset innovation, since the dataset used in this experiment is an original dataset collected by team members, the innovation in this aspect has already been achieved.

For algorithm innovation, the experiment aims to modify and debug methods proposed in the papers "Autoformer: Decomposition Transformers with Auto-Correlation for Long-Term Series Forecasting" and "TimesNet: Temporal 2D-Variation Modeling for General Time Series Analysis", to evaluate their performance on the original dataset. The results will then be compared with traditional methods such as LSTM, RNN, and TCN, in order to explore an approache with superior performance.
